## Context

The user asked for help organizing their project files. We started by listing the directory
structure to understand what needed to be organized. The conversation involved switching
between different AI models during the day.

## Model Transitions
- 14:00: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 -> openai/gpt-4o

## Notes

This is a sample memory file with sufficient content to pass the sparse file detection.
It contains enough information about the day's activities to be considered adequate coverage.
The content threshold requires at least 1KB or 10 bytes per message to avoid being flagged.

Additional padding content to ensure the file has adequate size for testing purposes.
This ensures that the sparse detection algorithm will not flag this file as too small.
